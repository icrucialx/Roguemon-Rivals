Welcome to **Roguemon Rivals**, a competitive Roguelike Pokémon challenge where two players draft baby Pokémon across all 18 types and battle for supremacy. This format builds off the fan-made **Roguemon** By Crozwords, mod of FireRed/LeafGreen and brings structured 1v1 rivalry with leaderboard scoring, snake-style drafts, and type-based victories.
